## 🌱 About Me
- I write code **for fun**, not just for work
- I love **breaking things → fixing them → learning why**
- Big believer in **continuous learning & iteration**
- Obsessed with clean logic, simple designs, and *“why does this work?”*
- Currently exploring backend depth, performance & system design

---

## 🔧 Things I Enjoy Working With
- **Java** (Core, Streams, Concurrency)
- **Spring Boot** & REST APIs
- **Databases** – MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Docker** (because “it works on my machine” isn’t enough)
- Debugging weird bugs at 2 AM 😄

---

## 🧪 Currently Learning / Playing With
- Writing better, cleaner Java (less magic, more clarity)
- Performance tuning & JVM internals
- System design patterns (the *why*, not just the *what*)
- Cloud & infra basics
- Becoming a better problem solver every day
